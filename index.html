              Personal fouls include any type of illegal physical contact.
              <ul>
                <li> Hitting
                </li>
                <li> Pushing

                <li> Holding
                </li>
                <li> Illegal pick/screen - when an offensive player is moving. When an
                  offensive player sticks out a limb and makes physical contact with a
                  defender in an attempt to block the path of the defender. </li>
              </ul>
              <span> Inbounds:</span>
  
              <p> If fouled while not shooting, the ball is given to the team the foul was committed
                upon. They get the ball at the nearest side or baseline, out of bounds, and have 5
                seconds to pass the ball onto the court.
                If the team committing the foul has seven or more fouls in the game, then the
                player who was fouled is awarded one free throw. If he makes his first shot, then
                he is awarded another free throw.
                Ten or more fouls: if the team committing the foul has ten or more fouls, then
                the fouled player receives two free throws.</p>
              <span> Charging: </span>
              <p> An offensive foul that is committed when a player pushes or runs over a
                defensive player. The ball is given to the team that the foul was committed upon.
              </p>
              <span>Flagrant foul:</span>
              <p> Violent contact with an opponent. This includes hitting, kicking, and punching.
                This type of foul results in free throws plus the offense retaining possession of
                the ball after the free throws.</p>
              <span>Intentional foul:</span>
              <p>
                When a player makes physical contact with another player with no reasonable
                effort to steal the ball. It is a judgment call for the officials.</p>
              <span> Technical foul:</span>
              <p> It is about the &#39;manners&#39; of the game. Foul language, obscenity, obscene gestures,
                and even arguing can be considered a technical foul.</p>
              <p> Arguing with the referee will also be considered a technical foul. </p>
  
              <span> Violations </span>
              <p>
                Walking/traveling:
                Taking steps without dribbling or moving your pivot foot once you&#39;ve stopped
                dribbling is traveling.
                Carrying/palming: </p>
              <p> When a player dribbles the ball with his hand too far to the side of the ball or,
                sometimes, even under the ball. </p>
              <span> Double dribble:</span>
              <p> Dribbling the ball with both hands on the ball at the same time or picking up the
                dribble and then dribbling again is a double dribble.</p>
              <span> Held ball:</span>
              <p> Occasionally, two or more opposing players will gain possession of the ball at the
                same time. In order to avoid a prolonged and/or violent tussle, the referee stops
                the action and awards the ball to one team or the other on a rotating basis.</p>
              <span>Backcourt violation: </span>
              <p>Once the offense has brought the ball across the mid-court line, they cannot go
                back across the line during possession. If they do, the ball is awarded to the other
                team to pass inbounds.

              <h5> Rules:</h5>
              <span> 1. Games are played to 11 Points:</span>
              <p>
                A game is played upto 11 points. A game must be won by
                two points.
              </p>
              <span>2. Best of 3 (Till Semi's) and Best of 5(Semi Final & Final):</span>
              <p>
                Best of three is played till semi finals out of which the player
                needs to win two matches out of three to be considered the
                winner. In the finals, the player needs to win three out of five
                matches.
              </p>
              <span>3. Alternate serves every two points:</span>
              <p>
                Each side of the table alternates serving two points at a time.
                EXCEPTION: After tied 10-10 (“deuce”), service alternates
                at every point. Can you lose on a serve in ping pong? Yes!
                There is no separate rule for serving on Game Point.
              </p>
              <span>4. Toss the ball straight up when serving:</span>
              <p>
                How do you serve the ball in ping pong? Hold the ball in your
                open palm, behind your end of the table. Toss at least 6”
                straight up, and strike it on the way down. It must hit your
                side of the table and then the other side. NOTE: Once the
                ball leaves the server’s hand it is in play, and so counts as
                the receiver’s point if the ball is missed or mis-hit.
              </p>
              <span>5. The serve can land anywhere in singles:</span>
              <p>
                There is no restriction on where the ball lands on your side
                or your opponent’s side of the table. It can bounce two or
                more times on your opponent’s side (if so, that’s your point),
                bounce over the side, or even hit the edge.
  
              </p>
              <span>6.Double serves must go right court to right court:</span>
              <p>
                The serve must bounce in the server’s right court, and
                receiver’s right court (NOTE: landing on center line is fair).
                Doubles partners switch places after their team serves twice.
              </p>
              <span>7. A serve that touches the net when going over is a
                “let”:</span>
              <p>
                Can the ball hit the net in ping pong? Yes, during a RALLY, if
                it touches the top of the net and then otherwise lands as a
                legitimate hit. BUT not when serving. If a served ball hits the
                net on the way over and otherwise legally bounces in play,
                it’s a “let” serve and is done over. There is no limit on how
                many times this can happen.
              </p>
              <span>8. Alternate hitting in a doubles rally:</span>
              <p>
                Doubles partners must alternate hitting balls in a rally, no
                matter where the ball lands on the table.
              </p>
              <span>9. Volleys are not allowed:</span>
              <p>
                Can you hit the ball before it bounces in ping pong? No. In
                regular tennis you may “volley” the ball (hitting the ball
                before it bounces on your side of the net). But in table tennis,
                this results in a point for your opponent. NOTE: When your
                opponent hits a ball that sails over your end of the table
                without touching it and then hits you or your paddle, that is
                still your point.
              </p>
              <span>10. If you hit bounces back over the net by itself it is
                your point:</span>
              <p>
                If you hit the ball in a rally or on a serve and it bounces back
                over the net after hitting your opponent’s side of the table
                (due to extreme spin), without your opponent touching it, that
                is your point.
  
              </p>
              <span>11. Touching the ball with your paddle hand is allowed:</span>
              <p>
                What happens if the ball hits your finger or hand during a
                ping pong rally? If the ball touches your PADDLE hand and
                otherwise results in a legal hit, there is no rule violation and
                play shall continue as normal. Your paddle hand includes all
                fingers and hand area below the wrist. But what if the ball
                touches a player’s body anywhere else during a ping pong
                rally? You may not touch the ball with your non-paddle hand
                for any reason. It will result in a point for your opponent. BUT
                if your opponent’s hit sails over your side of the table without
                touching it, and hits any part of you or your paddle, that is
                still your point.
              </p>
              <span>12. You may not touch the ball with your non paddle
                hand:</span>
              <p>
                You may touch the ball or the table with your paddle hand
                (after reaching in to return a short serve, for example), or
                other parts of your body. NOTE: If the table moves at all from
                your touching it during a rally, that is your opponent’s point.
              </p>
              <span>13. An “Edge” ball bouncing of the horizontal table top
                surface is good.</span>
              <p>
                An otherwise legal serve or hit may contact the top edge of
                the horizontal table top surface and be counted as valid,
                even if it bounces sidewise. The vertical sides of the table
                are NOT part of the legal playing surface.
              </p>
              <span>14. Honor system applies to disagreements:</span>
              <p>
                If no referee is present during a match and the players
                disagree on a certain call, the “honor system” applies and
                the players should find a way to agree, or play the point over.
                Ping pong carries a tradition of fierce but fair play. Help us
                keep it that way!
